# kapture web and api

> Kapture is a tool to create a "personalized netflix server":  A cloud or pi-based device that provides simplified retrieval, storage, and redistribution of any media.


# Quickstart

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/kapturebox/web.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/kapturebox/web)
[![Docker Build Status](https://img.shields.io/docker/build/kapturebox/web.svg)](https://hub.docker.com/r/kapturebox/web)

## Vagrant

Start up whats intended to be a kapture box, including transmission, plex and the kapture app:

```
vagrant up
```

Will start up a new xenial instance locally, set up the machine, and then clean and build the npm project located in /vagrant

You can connect to the **packaged** instance that is in the apt repo on http://kapture-vagrant.local/

## Docker-compose

This repo is also built into a docker image: `kapturebox/web`.  The docker-compose file will spin up all dependent services:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

This will spin up the kapture service running on port `:9000` wherever your docker environment lives (usually [http://localhost:9000](http://localhost:9000))




# Development

## Running locally without components

This can be run on your local box for easier developing, however it won't have transmission to download files and flexget to auto-kapture stuff.  Everything else (searching, UI, settings, etc) should work fine:

```bash
npm install -g grunt-cli bower yarn
npm install
bower install
grunt serve
```

You'll then have a server running at: http://localhost:9000

## All components in vagrant

```
vagrant ssh
cd /vagrant ; grunt serve
```

Then you will have a server running @ http://kapture-vagrant.local:9000

## Useful environment variables

| Variable        | Default      | Options |
| --------------- | ------------ | ------- |
| ```LOG_LEVEL``` | info         | error, warn, info, debug |
| ```NODE_ENV```  | development  | production, development |

If installed via package, can be configured via the following systemd file:

    /etc/systemd/system/kapture.service





## Building

Run:

```

```

Then simply connect to http://localhost:9000
